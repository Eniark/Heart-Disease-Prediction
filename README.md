# Heart-Disease-Prediction

One of my first end-to-end ML projects. I tried applying some statistical tests like ANOVA, Chi2, Cramer V test, Shapiro-Wilk etc.
P.s. I have to note that I'm not that experienced in finding relationships between variables and have some questions regarding that.

I created a Baseline model with 82% using accuracy as metric.
